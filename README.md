# Blackjack

A blackjack game made with Python 3.8, along with the Pygame module.

The purpose of this project is to help me learn/reinforce my learning of Python,
and Pygame.

### Resources I used to help me figure stuff out:
    1. "Python OOP - Deck of Cards" by Executed Binary (YouTube)
    2. Various GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow and various other websites.
    3. Pygame documentation.
