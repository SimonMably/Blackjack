# Blackjack

A command line variant of blackjack made with Python 3.8.
The purpose of this project is to help me learn/reinforce my learning of Python.

I intend to add a GUI using pygame in the future.

### Resources I used to help me figure stuff out:
    1. "Python OOP - Deck of Cards" by Executed Binary (YouTube)
